We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, August 29:</b> First day!  After attempting to learn names, we launched in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf">Setting the Stage</a> activity.  I was impressed by the level of engagement and everyone's willingness to share.  Some wonderful ideas were discussed! The last bit of class was devoted to touring the course website and discussing a few important items from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411f16/syllabus/">syllabus</a>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, August 31:</b> Absolutely spectacular first day of presentations.  I was extremely impressed that so many people readily volunteered. After dividing the class up into several small groups to discuss the homework problems, we had LL, AT, JM, JS, AO, EB, SS1, and MR present 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.13, respectively.  Along the way, we also discussed 2.3 and 2.12 as a class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 2:</b> This might be the best start to the semester that I've ever experienced.  Awesome discussions so far. After answering a few quick questions, we split up into small groups just like last time.  We had DJ, SC, KS, SS1, and KE present 2.16/2.17, 2.18, 2.20, 2.21, and 2.22, respectively.  Along the way, I quickly discussed 2.19.  We were short on time at the end, so I very quickly summarized 2.24 and 2.25.  We never go to 3.1-3.3, so we will start with those next time.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 5:</b> Labor Day. No class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 7:</b> We got a lot done today and all the discussion was productive.  We kicked off with me explaining 3.1 and 3.2, which were left over from last time, and I also quickly explained 3.4.  After that we split up into small groups to discuss the remaining problems.  LG, SS1, JC, BG, JH, and PM present 3.5/3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9(c)/3.10(cd), 3.11(g), and 3.12(g), respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 9:</b> I spent the first 25 minutes or so discussing the use of LaTeX. Remember to holler if you have questions.  The rest of class was spent discussing 3.13 and 3.14, which SM and DJ presented, respectively.  If needed, we will revisit 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 12:</b> I was out of town and David Deville covered for me.  According to David, here is what transpired.  JS, LG, JC, MR, EB, LL, and BG presented 4.2/4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.10, and 4.11, respectively.  We should have time to hit up 4.12-4.14 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 14:</b> Today was a recalibration day.  I spent the entire time lecturing over 4.12-4.15.  We kick off Friday by finishing up discussion of 4.19-4.22.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 16:</b> Great day and one of my favorite topics!  After a quick summary of how to verify that two groups are or are not isomorphic using Cayley diagrams, we split up into 6 small groups.  I presented 4.19 and 4.20 and then we had DZ, HR, KE, SM, AO, and ZP discuss 4.21, 4.22, 4.23, 4.24, 4.25, and 4.26, respectively.</li>
</ul>



## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 19:</b> We got a lot accomplished today.  I spent the first few minutes discussing some thoughts about the first Weekly Homework assignment and then we got down to business.  We had JM, AO, AT, AN, SC, and HR present 4.27/4.28, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 5.13, 5.14, and 5.16, respectively.  Along the way I presented 5.8 and then we wrapped up with the proof of Theorem 5.14 (function composition is associative).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 21:</b> We kicked off with a whole class discussion of 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, and 5.23.  These problems were aimed at developing intuition about the formal definition of a group.  Next, we had people work in groups of 2-3 on coming up with a proof for Theorem 5.24, which says that the identity in a group is unique.  After about 5 minutes, we had JM, SS2, and PM share 3 different proposed proofs.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 23:</b> Today is a perfect example of why I use to implement an IBL approach in this course.  Awesome discussion and many light bulbs getting turned on!  We had JM, KE, KS, JK, AN, JH, and DZ present 5.25, 5.26, 5.27, 5.28, 5.30, 5.32(a), and 5.32(b), respectively. With the few minutes we had left at the end of class, we had quick group discussion of 5.33 and 5.34.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 26:</b> Another highly productive day.  After discussing the upcoming exam, we got down to business.  We started by me discussing 5.36, 5.39, and 5.40.  Then we broke up into 6 small groups to discuss most of the remaining problems.  We had JK, AN, MR, LL, PM, and SC present 5.35, 5.37, 5.38, 5.41, 5.43, and 5.44, respectively.  Along the way, I also addressed 5.42 and discussed the phrase "up to isomorphism."</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 28:</b> The students took the in-class portion of Exam 1.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 30:</b> Since the students are working on the take-home portion of Exam 1, I spent the day lecturing.  We began by reviewing the groups we are familiar with and organized them by order and identified which ones were isomorphic to others on our list.  Next, we had lengthy discussion of Problem 5.45, which classifies groups of order 4.  With the time we had left, we briefly discussed 5.46 and 5.47, which addresses one of the flaws with our original set of 4 rules that defined a group.</li>
</ul>

## Week 6 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, October 3:</b> After handing back the in-class portion of Exam 1 (I'm happy with how everyone did, by the way!), we picked up where we left off last week.  When all was said and done, we discussed 5.46-5.55.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, October 5:</b> The energy level was a bit low today, but I'm really happy with how things went.  SS1, LL, DJ, JM, HR, EB, and SC present 5.56(b), 5.56(c), 5.57, 5.61, 5.62, 5.63, and 5.64, respectively.  Along the way, I quickly addressed 5.58.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, October 7:</b> Today was a good example of where we tried to do too much.  As a result, I think we missed out on an opportunity to resolve some confusion about subgroup lattices.  We had AO, JH, KS, DZ, JC, MR, and SS2 present 5.67, 5.68, 5.69, 5.70, 5.71, 5.72, and 5.73, respectively.  We will review a couple of these next time and hit up Theorem 5.66 and tackle Exercise 5.74 and Problem 5.75.</li>
</ul>
