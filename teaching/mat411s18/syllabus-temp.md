### Exams ###
There will be three midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.  Each exam will be worth 18% of your overall grade.  Moreover, each exam will consist of an in-class portion (weighted 70%) and a take-home portion (weighted 30%).  The in-class portions of the midterm exams are *tentatively* scheduled for **Friday, February 9**, **Friday, March 9**, and **Friday, April 13**.  The take-home portions of midterm exams will typically be due the following Wednesday.  The final exam is schedule for **Wednesday, May 9** at 10:00AM-12:00PM.  Make-up exams will only be given under extreme circumstances, as judged by me.  In general, it will be best to communicate conflicts ahead of time.


### Piazza ###
This term we will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. I will also use Piazza to post important announcements. Sometime during the first week of classes, I will send the class an invite to Piazza and briefly discuss its use. You can find our class page [here](https://piazza.com/nau/spring2018/mat411/home).

Also, add blurb to Textbook, LMS, Homework, and Getting Help. Search for "Google Group" in syllabus for Calculus 1 Fall 2015.

### Class Presentations and Participation ###

#### General Comments

The problems chosen for presentations will come from the Daily Homework assignments. Though the atmosphere in this class should be informal and friendly, what we do in the class is serious business. In particular, the presentations made by students are to be taken seriously since they spearhead the work of the class. Here are some of my expectations for the presenter:

- The purpose of class presentations is not to prove to me that the presenter has done the problem. It is to make the ideas of the solution clear to the other students.
- Presenters should explain their reasoning as they go along, not simply write everything down and then turn to explain.
- Fellow students are allowed to ask questions at any point and it is the responsibility of the person making the presentation to answer those questions to the best of his or her ability.
- Since the presentation is directed at the students, the presenter should frequently make eye-contact with the students in order to address questions when they arise and also be able to see how well the other students are following the presentation.

#### Assessing Presentations

Presentations will be assessed using the following rubric.

- U: Unsatisfactory. Minimal progress was made that included relevant information. Alternatively, the student was unprepared.
- I: Incomplete or in progress. The student made an honest attempt at the problem but recognized a flaw that prevented them from being able to complete the problem during the presentation. Alternatively, the student reported on their current progress on a problem and attempted to convey where or why they are currently "stuck".
- S: Satisfactory. The student demonstrated an understanding of the problem and presented the key ideas. Perhaps some details were omitted or interesting mistakes were made. The presentation led to fruitful class discussion.
- E: Exceptional. The presentation was flawless and the student demonstrated keen insight into the problem.

You should aim to avoid unsatisfactory (U) presentations. An incomplete or in progress (I) presentation should not be viewed as a bad thing as each of us will occasionally get stuck. However, you should strive for the majority of your presentations to be satisfactory (S) or exceptional (E).  Most presentations will be satisfactory (S) while exceptional (E) presentations will be rare. You should not let the rubric deter you from presenting if you have an idea about a solution/proof that you'd like to present, but you are worried that your solution/proof is incomplete or you are not confident your solution/proof is correct.  You will be rewarded for being courageous and sharing your creative ideas!  In my view, an interestingly wrong solution or proof makes for the best presentation since it generates the best discussion. This is really what we are after. However, you should not come to the board to present unless you have spent time thinking about the problem and have something meaningful to contribute. I will provide a progress report concerning each student's presentation history after each of the midterm exams.

#### Selecting Presenters

In general, I will curate the list of student presenters each class meeting.  A presenter is a student that either volunteered (V) or was chosen (C) by me. Volunteering is encouraged, but being chosen without volunteering isn't bad. If more than one student volunteers for a specific problem, the student with the fewest number of presentations has priority.  I reserve the right to decline your offer to present. This may happen if you are volunteering too often (and hence removing another student's opportunity to present) or if I know in advance that another student's presentation will lead to a fruitful discussion.

If you are chosen to present but would prefer not to present that particular problem, you can either negotiate presenting a different problem or take a pass (P). You may elect to pass at most three times during the semester, after which a presentation will be be deemed unsatisfactory (U). By default, if you have an unexcused absence on a day when you have been chosen to present, then your presentation will be recorded as a pass (P) unless you have already exhausted your three passes, in which case the presentation will be recorded as unsatisfactory (U).

In summary:

- V: Volunteer. Student volunteered during class or in advance to present.
- C: Chosen. Student was selected by the instructor and agreed to present.
- P: Pass. Student was selected to present, but asked to take a pass. Allowed at most three.

For each student presentation, I will record one of V, C, or P. In the case of V or C, I will also record one of U, I, S, or E based on the rubric given above. The most common pair will likely be C,S.

#### Participation

You expected to respectfully particpate and contribute to class discussions. This includes asking relevant and meaningful questions to both the instructor and your peers. Moreover, you are expected to be engaged and respectful during another student's presentation. Your class participation will be assessed as follows:

- U: Unsatisfactory. Student was often disengaged or disrespectful. Alternatively, the student regularly missed class.
- S: Satisfactory. Student was respectful, engaged, and contributed to meaningful class discussions. In addition, the student regularly attends class.
- E: Exceptional. Student's presence in the classroom truly enhances the learning environment.

#### Assessing Presentation and Participation Grades

Your Presentation and Participation grade is determined by your frequencey and ability to foster productive class discussions through presentations and audience participation. The greatest determinging factor in your Presentation and Participation grade is your willingness to present often. You should aim to present at least twice prior to each midterm exam.  The table below provides a summary of how your Presentation and Participation grade will be determined.
