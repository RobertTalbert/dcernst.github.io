### Exams ###
There will be three midterm exams and a cumulative final exam.  Each exam will be worth 18% of your overall grade.  Moreover, each exam will consist of an in-class portion (weighted 70%) and a take-home portion (weighted 30%).  The in-class portions of the midterm exams are *tentatively* scheduled for **Friday, February 9**, **Friday, March 9**, and **Friday, April 13**.  The take-home portions of midterm exams will typically be due the following Wednesday.  The final exam is schedule for **Wednesday, May 9** at 10:00AM-12:00PM.  Make-up exams will only be given under extreme circumstances, as judged by me.  In general, it will be best to communicate conflicts ahead of time.


### Piazza ###
This term we will be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. I will also use Piazza to post important announcements. Sometime during the first week of classes, I will send the class an invite to Piazza and briefly discuss its use. You can find our class page [here](https://piazza.com/nau/spring2018/mat411/home).

Also, add blurb to Textbook, LMS, Homework, and Getting Help. Search for "Google Group" in syllabus for Calculus 1 Fall 2015.

### Class Presentations and Participation ###
Though the atmosphere in this class should be informal and friendly, what we do in the class is serious business. In particular, the presentations made by students are to be taken seriously since they spearhead the work of the class.  Here are some of my expectations:

- The purpose of class presentations is not to prove to me that the presenter has done the problem. It is to make the ideas of the solution clear to the other students.
- Presenters should explain their reasoning as they go along, not simply write everything down and then turn to explain.
- Fellow students are allowed to ask questions at any point and it is the responsibility of the person making the presentation to answer those questions to the best of his or her ability.
- Since the presentation is directed at the students, the presenter should frequently make eye-contact with the students in order to address questions when they arise and also be able to see how well the other students are following the presentation.

Presentations will be assessed using the following rubric.

U = Unsatisfactory. Minimal progress was made that included relevant information. Alternatively, the student was unprepared.

I = Incomplete or in progress. The student made an honest attempt at the problem but recognized a flaw that prevented them from being able to complete the problem during the presentation. Alternatively, the student reported on their current progress on a problem and attempted to convey where or why they are currently "stuck".  

S = Satisfactory. The student demonstrated an understanding of the problem and presented the key ideas. Perhaps some details were omitted or interesting mistakes were made. The presentation led to fruitful class discussion.

E = Exceptional. The presentation was flawless and the student demonstrated keen insight into the problem.

P = Pass. The student was selected to present, but asked to take a pass.

Comments: Students should aim to avoid unsatisfactory (U) presentations. An incomplete or in progress (I) presentation should not be viewed as a bad thing as each of us will occasionally get stuck. However, each student should strive for the majority of their presentations to be satisfactory (S) or exceptional (E).  Most presentations will be satisfactory (S) while exceptional (E) presentations will be rare. A student may choose to pass (P) after being selected to present up to three times, after which a presentation will be be deemed unsatisfactory (U). If a student has an unexcused absence on a day when they have been selected to present, then the presentation will be recorded as a pass (P) unless the student has already exhausted their three passes, in which case the presentation will be recorded as unsatisfactory (U).

C = Chosen. The student was selected by the instructor and agreed to present.
V = Volunteer. The student volunteered during class or in advance to present.

Comments: Volunteering is good, but being selected without volunteering isn't bad.


Todo: Add examples or descriptions for benchmarks for letter grades. Add H = Hold? For student that want to come back to a problem.

However, you should not let the rubric deter you from presenting if you have an idea about a solution/proof that you'd like to present, but you are worried that your solution/proof is incomplete or you are not confident your solution/proof is correct.  You will be rewarded for being courageous and sharing your creative ideas!  Yet, you should not come to the board to present unless you have spent time thinking about the problem and have something meaningful to contribute.

In general, I will curate the list of student presenters each class meeting.  However, students are welcome to volunteer. This type of behavior will be rewarded. If more than one student volunteers, the student with the fewest number of presentations has priority.  The problems chosen for presentations will come from the Daily Homework assignments.  Each student in the audience is expected to be engaged and respectful during another student's presentation.

In order to receive a **passing grade** on the presentation portion of your grade, **you must present at least twice prior to each of the three midterm exams and at least once after the third midterm exam**  for a total of at least 7 times during semester. Notice that I've described a minimum.  To ensure a good grade, you should present as often as you can. Your overall performance during presentations, as well as your level of interaction/participation during class, will be worth 14% of your overall grade.
