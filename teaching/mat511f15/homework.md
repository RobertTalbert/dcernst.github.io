When doing your homework, I encourage you to use the [Elements of Style for Proofs]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/ElementsOfStyle.pdf) as a reference. **Note:** On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Daily/Weekly Homework number.

Unless a student has a documented excused absence, late homework will not be accepted.  You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work.

## Daily Homework ##
The following assignments are to be turned in at the end of the indicated class period. I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises. Students are allowed (in fact, encouraged!) to modify their written solutions in light of class discussions; however, **you are required to use the colored marker pens provided in class**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat511f15/syllabus) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the test dates only count as one item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, September 2)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Friday, September 4 by 5PM)
- **Daily Homework 3:** Coming soon.  (Due Wednesday, September 2)

## Weekly Homework ##
In addition to the Daily Homework, we will also have Weekly Homework assignments. For most of these assignments, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written solutions/proofs. You are required to type your submission using $\LaTeX$ or Lyx (see below for more on this). I will walk you through how to do this.

- Coming soon!
