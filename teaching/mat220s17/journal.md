We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 18:</b> First day!  After attempting to learn names, we took a tour of the course webpage and then discussed an overview of the course and the syllabus.  Next, groups of 2-3 pondered Problem 1 from the problem collection for a short bit before we had a brief full-class discussion about it.  We wrapped up with a quick discussion of Problem 2. Comically, I accidentally ended class 10 minutes early.  I won't do that again.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 20:</b> Great first day of student presentations.  I'm extremely happy with how things went. After answering a few quick questions, we divided the class up into 6 small groups, each tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.  Groups spent about 20 minutes kicking around ideas related to their respective problem and then we had representatives from each group share out.  Both LL and LB each presented an approach to Problem 1 and then SS discussed Problem 3.  KG chimed in on Problem 3 along the way.  We wrapped up with BR presenting his take on Problem 4(a).</li>
