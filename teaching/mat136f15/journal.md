We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, August 31:</b> First day!  We spent the majority of the time doing the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf">Setting the Stage</a> activity, which generated lots of great discussion.  The last 10-15 minutes of class were spent discussing the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a> and surfing the course webpage.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 2:</b> The first few minutes of class were devoted to reviewing some key  aspects of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/syllabus.pdf">syllabus</a>.  Next, we divided the class into groups A-F and each group was tasked with putting their proposed solution to a particular problem from Daily Homework 3 up on the white board.  During this time, Hannah and I circulated around the room listening and chiming in when necessary.  We spent the last 10 minutes having a few groups share out.  NH presented Problems 3 and 4, MM3 presented parts of Problem 5, and RF presented Problems 7 and 8.  I am thrilled with how the first set of presentations went! I apologize that more students did not get to present.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Thursday, September 3:</b> After some announcements, we played around with <a href="https://webwork.math.nau.edu/webwork2/DErnst_136">WeBWorK</a> and chatted about Weekly Homework 1.  The last 20 minutes of class was reserved for students taking the Calculus Readiness Quiz.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 4:</b> Class began with a few brief announcements and then I did a quick mini-lecture on function transformations.  Next, we split the class up into four groups.  While each group discussed one of the homework problems, Hannah and I milled around to see what questions people had.  The last 15 minutes of class was devoted to students presenting their group's work.  AG and HD presented Problems 10 and 11, respectively, that were left over from Daily Homework 3.  Then NH and BL showed us Problems 12(d) and 14(b), respectively.  We wrapped up with a presentation of Problems 15(f), 17, and 19 by SM. A great end to the first week.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 7:</b> Labor Day.  No classes!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 9:</b> After synthesizing some ideas about average rate of change, secant lines, and tangent lines, we launched into some presentations.  MM3 and TB presented Problems 21 and 22, TR discussed Problem 26, and finally TM walked us through Problem 31.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Thursday, September 10:</b> Today was aimed at synthesizing ideas and solidifying concepts.  We postponed doing any presentations and I lectured over the intuitive approach to derivatives.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 11:</b> Great day!  Maybe it was because the radiator thing in the back of the room was finally quite, but I think it was because the student presentations were awesome. First, EB did an excellent job discussing Problem 40.  Next, LL walked us through Problems 34 and 37, which spawned some great discussion.  Lastly, after announcing that she knew that she made a mistake, VK presented Problem 41 and addressed her mistake along the way.  With the few minutes we had left, I starting discussing limits and did a few quick graphical examples. </li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 14:</b> We did a lot today...maybe too much.  After passing last time, MM2 presented the big picture of Problem 43.  Next, we had JC, SR, EB, and BB present Problems 45, 47/48, 50, and 51, respectively.  After the student presentations, I spent time discussing to applets from <a href="http://dcernst.github.io/CalculusApplets/">Calculus Applets with GeoGebra</a> and then cranked out some examples involving limits.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 16:</b> I had a lot of fun today. We slowed the pace a bit and had students present problems live at the board.  We kicked off with PD presenting Problem 53.  This resulted in a quick conversation about notation.  Next, we had JE present Problem 54 (without his notes!).  This led to a discussion about limits that don't exist and how sometimes we can be more specific about how they don't exist if they march off to $\infty$ or $-\infty$.  Utilizing the discussion that followed Problem 54, SC was able to quickly dispense with Problem 52.  With the little time we had left, I drew a picture that captured the essence of Problems 56-58.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Thursday, September 17:</b> Yay! Great presentations by CW, JC, and EB, who did Problems 66, 67(a), and 67(c), respectively.  I also spent some time discussing limit laws and the Squeeze Theorem.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 18:</b> Today I spent a good chunk of time lecturing over a proof that $\lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta}=1$ using the Squeeze Theorem and then discussed one-sided limits.  As I was about to kick off discussing one-sided limits, HD volunteered to do an example for us.  Cool.  The last few minutes of class was spent on having students discussing Problems 72-75 with a partner while Hannah and I walked around and helped.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 21:</b> Today was a little chaotic and I think I'll take the blame on this one.  While likely entertaining, I probably spent too much time discussing my bike race that took place over the weekend.  Once we got started on doing calculus, I blitzed through solutions of Problems 73-75.  After that, MG walked us through various parts of Exercise 2.4.16 from "Calculus I Lecture Notes."  This would have gone better if the graph for the problem was displayed (unfornately, I couldn't get the doc camera working).  I totally lost track of time and when a few minutes over.  We decided to postpone the due date of Daily Homework 12 with the intention of wrapping up discussion of Daily Homework 11 on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 23:</b> Ah, that was better.  The first half of class was devoted to be cranking out some examples involving limits at infinity while the second half was a free-for-all for the students.  Hannah and I milled around while students worked on problems from Daily Homework 11, Daily Homework 12, or one of the reviews.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Thursday, September 24:</b> We spent the whole day reviewing for Exam 1.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, September 25:</b> Exam 1!</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, September 28:</b> Fun day!  After handing back exams (which the class did very well on as a whole), I did a mini-lecture on the formal definition of the derivative and highlighted what is to come over the next couple weeks.  With the 25 minutes that we had left, students worked in small groups on Daily Homework 13.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, September 30:</b> Coming soon.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Thursday, October 1:</b> Coming soon.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, October 2:</b> Coming soon.</li>
</ul>
