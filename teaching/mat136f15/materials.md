## Calculus Videos ##
There are tons of calculus related videos out there.  In fact, I've listed a few popular resources further down the page.  Below, I've posted links to videos that I feel are particularly relevant to our discussion of calculus.  Most of the videos come from [MOOCulus](https://mooculus.osu.edu/).

- [Introduction to WeBWorK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqv2dk70IFw). **Note:** There are some inconsistencies in this video due to the fact that I made it for my Fall 2012 class.  The version of WeBWorK has been upgraded, but it should still be useful.

<!-- ## Reviews for Exams ##
To study for your exams, I recommend looking over and redoing as many homework problems as possible.  This includes Daily and Weekly Homework.  The correct answers for WeBWorK problems are always made available after an assignment's due date.  In addition, you should read over examples done in class and make sure you understand them.  The review sheets posted below provide additional information about what sections and what topics you should be familiar with prior to each exam.
