Unless a student has a documented excused absence, late homework will not be accepted.  There are many resources available to assist you with doing your homework (e.g., office hours, course Google Group, free tutoring at numerous places across campus). You are allowed and encouraged to work together on homework.  However, each student is expected to turn in his or her own work.

You are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the [course Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mat-136-google-group-fall-2015), as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from.  You can also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always [email me](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).  Lastly, *free* tutoring is available in AMB 137 through the [Math Achievement Program](http://nau.edu/student-learning-centers/).

## Daily Homework ##

The Daily Homework will generally consist of solving problems from the [IBL course notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) (PDF).  On the day that a homework assignment is due, the majority of the class period will be devoted to students presenting some subset (maybe all) of the solutions/proofs that are due that day. Students are allowed (in fact, encouraged!) to modify their written solutions in light of presentations made in class; however, **you are required to use the colored marker pens provided in class**.

- **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/syllabus) and write down 5 important items.  *Note:*  All of the test dates only count as one item.  Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Wednesday, 9/2)
- **Daily Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I'm not there, just slide note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Friday, 9/4 by 5PM)
- **Daily Homework 3:** Read the Introduction and Chapter 0 up to Problem 11 of [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) (PDF) and complete Problems 3-11.  In addition, skim through the Introduction and Chapter 1 of *Calculus I Lecture Notes*. (Due Wednesday, 9/2)

For Problem 14, feel free to use a graphing calculator or a computer to obtain the graph of the function. (Due Friday, 9/4)
- **Daily Homework 6:** Read Chapter 1 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 32 and complete Problems 21-29, 31, 32. *Hint:* Problem 25 is hinting at tangent lines (see Definition 30). (Due Wednesday, 9/9)
- **Daily Homework 7:** Read the rest of Chapter 1 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 41 and complete Problems 33-35, 37-41. *Hints:* For Problem 34, use Problem 26 and the idea from Problem 25. For Problem 35 use the same approach as Problem 34. For Problems 37 and 38, use Problems 33 and 34, respectively. (Due Friday, September 11)
- **Daily Homework 8:** Read the rest of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 in [Differential Calculus]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/mat136f15/DifferentialCalculus-JIBLM.pdf) up to Problem 51.  In addition, complete Problems 43-45, 47-51. *Note:* For Problems 47-51, feel free to utilize technology to graph the functions, but you should also attempt to explore the functions algebraically. (Due Monday, September 14)

<!--
- **Daily Homework 7:** Read the rest of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 up to Problem 54.  In addition, complete Problems 43-45, 47-54. *Note:* For Problems 47-54, feel free to utilize technology to graph the functions, but you should also attempt to explore the functions algebraically. (Due Friday, September 5)
- **Daily Homework 8:** Read Chapter 2 up to Theorem 68.  In addition, complete Problems 56-58, 66, 67.

(Due Wednesday, September 10)
- **Daily Homework 9:** Read the rest of Chapter 2.  In addition, complete Problems 69-75. For Problem 69, you should just look up the answer (e.g., use a Google search). *Hints:* For Problem 72, you cannot "pull the 4 out of the sine function".  However, a key observation is that $4\theta\to 0$ as $\theta\to 0$. For Problem 73, consider multiplying the expression by $4/4$.  For Problem 74, consider multiplying by the conjugate and using a relevant trig identity.  For Problem 75, use the Sandwich/Squeeze Theorem. (Due Thursday, September 11)

To compute the derivatives of the functions for Problem 137, you should use the derivatives that I just mentioned and the quotient rule.  (Due Friday, September 26)
