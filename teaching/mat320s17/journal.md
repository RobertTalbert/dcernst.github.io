We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.
</p>

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 18:</b> First day!  After attempting to learn names, I discussed the first few homework assignments and summarized what content can be found on the course webpage. Next, we spent a few minutes on an activity that I called [Deep Learning and Productive Struggle]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat320s17/DeepPractice.pdf). We wrapped up class by doing a quick overview of the syllabus.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 20:</b> Great first day of student presentations!  I was really pleased with how things went.  After answering a few quick questions and making some announcements, groups of 2-3 spent a couple minutes discussing their homework.  Next, we had LS volunteer to present a proof of Theorem 2.3.  LS did a great job and her proof generated lots of good discussion.  Afterwards, JN volunteered to present a proof of Theorem 2.4, which also provoked good discussion.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, January 23:</b> Since classes starting after noon were canceled, we ended class 20 minutes early.  With the time we had available, we revisited the definition of even and odd and took at look at the definition of "divides".  In particular, we discussed some pitfalls related to the notation (see Question 2.11).  In addition, we spent a little time discussing the difference between "proofs" and "counterexamples".  Along the way, we tackled Problem 2.5, Problem 2.7, Theorem 2.14, and Problem 2.16.  At some point, we still need to address Problems 2.8, 2.9, 2.12, and 2.13, as well as Corollary 2.15 and Theorem 2.17.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 25:</b> I was really happy with how things went today.  Lots of good discussion and comments.  We jumped right in and had SC, DF, QC, SG, and JN1 present Problem 2.8, Problem 2.12, Problem 2.13, Corollary 2.15, and Theorem 2.17, respectively.  JO, TC, and JR will tackle Theorem 2.18, Problem 2.19, and Theorem 2.20 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 27:</b> A productive day.  We had JO, TC, JR, JQ, and RF presented Theorem 2.18, Problem 2.19, Theorem 2.20, Problem 2.21, and Theorem 2.22, respectively.  Along the way, we discussed an alternate proof of Theorem 2.20.  CP will tackle Theorem 2.23 at the beginning of class next time.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, January 30:</b> We kicked of with CP presenting Theorem 2.25.  Next, we split the class into several small groups.  After several minutes, we had DD, FA, SR, and EV share out about Exercise 2.25.  Next, SG and DF presented Exercise 2.27 and Exercise 2.28, respectively.  We will get to Exercise 2.31, Problem 2.32, and Theorem 2.34 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 1:</b> Coming soon.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 3:</b> Coming soon.</li>
