We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 20:</b> First day!  After attempting to learn names, we launched in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf">Setting the Stage</a> activity.  I was impressed by the level of engagement and everyone's willingness to share.  Some wonderful ideas were discussed! The last bit of class was devoted to touring the course website and discussing a few important items from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s16/syllabus/">syllabus</a>.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 22:</b> Great first day of student presentations!  I was extremely impressed that so many people readily volunteered.  After answering a few quick questions about the syllabus, I spent a few minutes highlighting a few key features of Spinpossible.  Next, we had JK, GG, LF, IA, EO, KS, and ES present 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, and 2.9, respectively.  I was really pleased with how the presentations went, both for the presenters and for the audience. We didn't get to 2.10-2.12.  We might come back to these on Monday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, January 25:</b> Today was a busy day.  As is typical at this point in the course notes, confusion and understanding seem to wax and wane, but I'm not at all worried about it.  After a quick discussion about possible ambiguities in our intuitive rules for a group, we had AM2, HG, CS, MT, SW, SC, RW, and AM1 present 2.10 (outstanding from last time), 2.13, 2.15, 2.16/2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.21, and 2.22, respectively.  With the few minutes of class we had remaining, I discussed 2.20 and 2.23.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 27:</b> Once again we didn't get through all the problems, but I felt like we covered quite a bit of material.  The first 15 minutes or so was devoted to me summarizing a few key ideas about Cayley diagrams.  I also discussed problems 2.24, 2.25, 3.4, and 3.7.  Next, we had AW, CL, NW, and EO presented 3.1, 3.2/3.3, 3.5/3.6, and 3.8, respectively.  We'll have AH and MT present 3.9 and 3.10, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 29:</b> The first half of class was devoted to introducing the use of LaTeX.  The rest of our class session was devoted to AH, MT, and AT presenting 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11, respectively.  Along the way, I provided alternate drawing of the Cayley diagram for Exercise 3.11, so that we could compare to AT's version.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 1:</b> Today was a good day.  We had KF, AW, BS, JK, CM, and RV present 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17, respectively.  Exercise 3.14 is an important one to keep in mind.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 3:</b> I had my doubts about getting through everything today.  We came really close.  All of today's problems were related to the concept of subgroup.  We had KG, CS, ER, BA, CL, IA, and AM present 4.3, 4.5, 4.6/4.7/4.8, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, and 4.13/4.14, respectively.  We didn't get to 4.15, which KS will kick off with next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 5:</b> Today's problems focused on understanding when two groups are isomorphic.  The problems presented today are among my favorite in the course.  It was an action-packed day with KS, MT, AH, ES, SC, MN, AM, and EO presenting 4.15, 4.16, 4.19, 4.20, 4.23/4.24, 4.25, and 4.26, respectively.  We didn't get to 4.27/4.28.  MT will kick off with those on Monday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 4 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 8:</b> The major theme of the day was binary operations.  After a short discussion of where we are headed, MT presented 4.27/4.28.  Next, we had KG, KW, RV, RW, AM, and EO presented 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, 5.11, 5.13, and 5.14, respectively.  EO's attempt at Theorem 5.14 was pretty close, but had some minor notational issues.  Nonetheless, I was impressed.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 10:</b> The first few minutes of class were devoted to discussing the upcoming exam.  Next, we looked at some interesting errors on student work from Weekly Homework 1.  This took quite a bit of time, but I think it was worthwhile.  With the time we had left, BA, HG, and FT presented 5.16, 5.17, and 5.20, respectively.  There were a bunch of problems that we didn't get to. Andrew will be covering for me on Friday and he will pick up where we left off.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 12:</b> Andrew covered for me while I was out of town.  According to his notes, MN, SW, LF, NW, ER, BS, EO, and GG presented 5.21, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 5.26, 5.27, 5.28, and 5.29, respectively.</li>
</ul>

## Week 5 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 15:</b> We chatted very briefly about the exam and then I spent a few minutes comparing solving equations in linear algebra to solving equations in the context of groups.  Next, we had CM, FT, AT, KF, RV, and KS present 5.30, 5.32, 5.33, 5.34, 5.35, and 5.37, respectively.  There were a few problems we didn't get to and students do not need to worry about these for the exams.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 17:</b> The students took the in-class portion of Exam 1.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 12:</b> After a quick discussion of the take-home portion of Exam 1, we took care of a few outstanding problems.  We had ES, SC, and IA present 5.38, 5.40, and 5.41, respectively.  Next, I spent a few minutes summarizing "the taxonomy of groups" and the phrase "up to isomorphism."  I then lectured over 5.39, 5.42, 5.43, and 5.45.  I'll continue lecturing until the take-home exam is due next week.</li>
</ul>

## Week 6 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 22:</b> After handing back the in-class portion of Exam 1, I launched into lecturing.  We picked up where we left off on Friday with a discussion of the taxonomy of groups and then continued on with the course notes.  I covered 5.46-5.51</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 24:</b> Coming soon.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 26:</b> Coming soon.</li>
