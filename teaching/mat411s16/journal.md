We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.

## Week 1 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 20:</b> First day!  After attempting to learn names, we launched in the [Setting the Stage]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf) activity.  I was impressed by the level of engagement and everyone's willingness to share.  Some wonderful ideas were discussed! The last bit of class was devoted to touring the course website and discussing a few important items from the [syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/teaching/mat411s16/syllabus/).</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 22:</b> Great first day of student presentations!  I was extremely impressed that so many people readily volunteered.  After answering a few quick questions about the syllabus, I spent a few minutes highlighting a few key features of Spinpossible.  Next, we had JK, GG, LF, IA, EO, KS, and ES present 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, and 2.9, respectively.  I was really pleased with how the presentations went, both for the presenters and for the audience. We didn't get to 2.10-2.12.  We might come back to these on Monday.</li>
</ul>

## Week 2 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, January 25:</b> Today was a busy day.  As is typical at this point in the course notes, confusion and understanding seem to wax and wane, but I'm not at all worried about it.  After a quick discussion about possible ambiguities in our intuitive rules for a group, we had AM2, HG, CS, MT, SW, SC, RW, and AM1 present 2.10 (outstanding from last time), 2.13, 2.15, 2.16/2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.21, and 2.22, respectively.  With the few minutes of class we had remaining, I discussed 2.20 and 2.23.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, January 27:</b> Once again we didn't get through all the problems, but I felt like we covered quite a bit of material.  The first 15 minutes or so was devoted to me summarizing a few key ideas about Cayley diagrams.  I also discussed problems 2.24, 2.25, 3.4, and 3.7.  Next, we had AW, CL, NW, and EO presented 3.1, 3.2/3.3, 3.5/3.6, and 3.8, respectively.  We'll have AH and MT present 3.9 and 3.10, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, January 29:</b> The first half of class was devoted to introducing the use of [LaTeX]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/quick-latex-guide/).  The rest of our class session was devoted to AH, MT, and AT presenting 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11, respectively.  Along the way, I provided alternate drawing of the Cayley diagram for Exercise 3.11, so that we could compare to AT's version.</li>
</ul>

## Week 3 ##

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Monday, February 1:</b> Today was a good day.  We had KF, AW, BS, JK, CM, and RV present 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, and 3.17, respectively.  Exercise 3.14 is an important one to keep in mind.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Wednesday, February 3:</b> Coming soon. Test.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-calendar-check-o"></i><b>Friday, February 5:</b> Coming soon.</li>
