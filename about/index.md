  <p>
    Welcome! My name is Dana Ernst and I am an assistant professor in the <a href="http://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Flagstaff,+AZ&hl=en&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=57.161276,109.511719&oq=fl&hnear=Flagstaff,+Coconino,+Arizona&t=m&z=12">Flagstaff, AZ</a>. This blog is part of the <a href="http://boolesrings.org">Booles&#8217; Rings</a> network of academic home pages/blogs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My primary research interests are in the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic structures. More specifically, I study the combinatorics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_group">Coxeter groups</a> and their associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecke_algebra">Hecke algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazhdan%E2%80%93Lusztig_polynomial">Kazhdan-Lusztig theory</a>, generalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperley-Lieb_algebra">Temperley-Lieb algebras</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_algebra">diagram algebras</a>, and <a href="http://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/books/heaps.ps">heaps of pieces</a>. By employing combinatorial tools such as diagram algebras and heaps of pieces, one can gain insight into algebraic structures associated to Coxeter groups, and, conversely, the corresponding structure theory can often lead to surprising combinatorial results.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    More recently, my research has expanded into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial game theory</a> (joint with <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/ns46/">Nandor Sieben</a> and <a href="http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~bbenesh/">Bret Benesh</a>). In particular, our research has focused on avoidance and achievement games involving finite groups. See my <a href="http://danaernst.com/scholarship/">scholarship page</a> for more information.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The combinatorial nature of my research naturally lends itself to collaborations with undergraduate students, and my goal is to incorporate undergraduates in my research as much as possible. If you are an NAU student interested in conducting research in mathematics, please come talk to me! Occasionally, there may be funding available to pay students to do research. Check out my <a href="http://danaernst.com/scholarship/undergraduate-research/">undergraduate research page</a> for examples of recent projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My interests also include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship_of_Teaching_and_Learning">scholarship of teaching and learning</a> (SoTL) with a focus on <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) as an approach to teaching/exploring mathematics. I am currently a Special Projects Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org">Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning</a> and a mentor for several new IBL practitioners. Moreover, I actively give <a href="http://danaernst.com/scholarship/talks/">talks</a> and organize workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom.

    <!-- I am also interested in utilizing technology to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. Specifically, I choose free and [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software and technologies when appropriate. For example, I have been incorporating [Sage](http://sagemath.org) and [GeoGebra](http://www.geogebra.org/) into my teaching. Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  For examples of a few of the cool things you can do with Sage, check [this page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact).  According to their webpage, GeoGebra is free and multi-platform dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that joins geometry, algebra, tables, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.  There are tons of awesome GeoGebra examples located [here](http://www.geogebratube.org).  For other examples of the software that I use for teaching and staying productive, check out my [resources page](href="http://danaernst.com/resources/). -->
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <!-- In addition to using free and open-source software, I am inspired by the recent [open-source textbook](http://iae-pedia.org/Open_Source_Textbooks) movement and I strongly believe that educators should choose free, open-source, or low cost textbooks when a viable alternative exists. For a selection of free and/or open-source textbooks, see my list located [here](http://danaernst.com/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/). Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezer’s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/opentexts.html).  Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://www.aimath.org/textbooks/textbooklist.html). If you find one of the books list on any of the above links more helpful than another, please [let me know](mailto:dana@danaernst.com).  -->

    <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/">Angie Hodge</a> and I are coauthors for <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com">Math Ed Matters</a>, which is a (roughly) monthly column sponsored by the <a href="http://maa.org">Mathematical Association of America</a>. The column explores topics and current events related to undergraduate mathematics education. Posts aim to inspire, provoke deep thought, and provide ideas for the mathematics classroom. Our interest in and engagement with IBL color the column&#8217;s content.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Besides blogging here and for Math Ed Matters, I am also an editor for <a href="http://mathblogging.org">Mathblogging.org</a>, which is a site devoted to aggregating the multitude of math-related blogs and news sources across the Internet. My job as editor is to select a blog posts to be included in the <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/posts?type=post&filter0=recommender-status&value0=editor">Editors&#8217; Picks List</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Moreover, I am active on <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a> and post regularly about mathematics, teaching, and technology. You can find my G+ profile <a href="https://plus.google.com/107135522210834007871/posts">here</a>. You can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/danaernst">@danaernst</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IBLMath">@IBLMath</a>.

    Lastly, I am a husband and a father of two incredible sons. Oh, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee, too.
