  <h3>
    Calculus
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/handouts">MOOCulus Textbook</a> is a free textbook from the <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/">MOOCulus</a> folks at Ohio State University. This text is mostly an adaptation of the Community Calculus text listed below.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="communitycalculus.org">Community Calculus</a> by <a href="http://skink.whitman.edu/~guichard/">David Guichard</a> (Whitman College). This one is also available as a free PDF. You can also purchase a very inexpensive hardcopy from <a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/whitmancalculus">Lulu</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html">Active Calculus</a> by <a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/MB.html">Matt Boelkins</a> (Grand Valley State College). This is one of the newer additions to the list of free calculus texts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/">Calculus</a> by <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/">Gilbert Strang</a> (MIT). This book is available as a free PDF from the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT Open Courseware Project</a>. There are also some corresponding videos, which can be found <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/high-school/courses/highlights-of-calculus/index.htm">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/calculus/">Calculus Refresher</a> by <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/index.shtml">Paul Garrett</a> (University of Minnesota). Another free PDF. This short book seems designed for students who have had some experience with calculus and need some review.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/FLCT/index.html">Funny Little Calculus Text</a> by <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/index.html">Robert Ghrist</a> (University of Pennsylvania). Currently only first semester calculus, very short, and no exercises, but a free PDF.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul’s Online Math Notes</a> by <a href="http://www.math.lamar.edu/faculty/dawkins/dawkins.aspx">Paul Dawkins</a> (Lamar University). Paul&#8217;s notes cover Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, and more. The notes are available as free HTML-based material. These notes seem to be popular with students.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://wdjoyner.com/teach/calc1-sage/">Differential Calculus with Sage</a> by <a href="http://wdjoyner.com/">David Joyner</a> (United States Naval Academy) and Granville. This free book is available as either a PDF or in HTML form. The book covers first semester calculus and incorporates <a href="http://sagemath.org">Sage</a>, which is an open-source mathematics software package.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/teaching/calc2-sage/">Integral Calculus with Sage</a> by <a href="http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/">Dale Hoffman</a> (Bellevue Community College), <a href="http://modular.math.washington.edu/">William Stein</a> (University of Washington), and <a href="http://wdjoyner.com/">David Joyner</a> (United States Naval Academy). The book picks up where the previous book left off.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/Calculus_all/Calculus_all.html">Contemporary Calculus</a> by <a href="http://scidiv.bellevuecollege.edu/dh/">Dale Hoffman</a> (Bellevue Community College). A free online calculus text that is being developed for the <a href="http://opencourselibrary.org">Open Course Library Project of the Washington State Colleges</a>. This book is part of the foundation for the previous book. It covers three semesters of calculus and seems to do a thorough job of it, but the formatting is awful.
