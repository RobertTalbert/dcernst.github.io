    What is IBL?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <img src="http://i0.wp.com/danaernst.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/AIBL.png?w=149" alt="AIBL Logo" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-937" data-recalc-dims="1" />Let me begin by stating that this is a really difficult question to answer! <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">Inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) manifests itself differently in different contexts. In particular, an IBL practitioner often modifies his/her approach from one class to the next. In many mathematics classrooms, doing mathematics means following the rules dictated by the teacher and knowing mathematics means remembering and applying these rules. However, an IBL approach challenges students to think like mathematicians and to acquire their own knowledge by creating/discovering mathematics. In general, IBL is a student-centered method of teaching mathematics.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    According to the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org">Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning</a>, IBL engages students in sense-making activities. Students are given tasks requiring them to:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      solve problems,
    </li>
    <li>
      conjecture,
    </li>
    <li>
      experiment,
    </li>
    <li>
      explore,
    </li>
    <li>
      create,
    </li>
    <li>
      communicate.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Rather than showing facts or a clear, smooth path to a solution, the instructor guides and mentors students via well-crafted problems through an adventure in mathematical discovery. Effective IBL courses encourage deep engagement in rich mathematical activities and provide opportunities to collaborate with peers (either through class presentations or group-oriented work). These are known as the &#8220;twin pillars&#8221; in <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/eer/research/steminquiry.html">Sandra Laursen&#8217;s work on IBL</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Perhaps this is sufficiently vague, but I believe that there are two essential elements to IBL. Students should as much as possible be responsible for:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Guiding the acquisition of knowledge, and
    </li>
    <li>
      Validating the ideas presented. (That is, students should not be looking to the instructor as the sole authority.)
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    For me, the guiding principle of IBL is the following question:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Where do I draw the line between content I must impart to my students versus the content they can produce independently?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    E. Lee May (Salisbury State University) may have said it best:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Inquiry-based learning (IBL) is a method of instruction that places the student, the subject, and their interaction at the center of the learning experience. At the same time, it transforms the role of the teacher from that of dispensing knowledge to one of facilitating learning. It repositions him or her, physically, from the front and center of the classroom to someplace in the middle or back of it, as it subtly yet significantly increases his or her involvement in the thought-processes of the students.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>
    The Moore Method
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    IBL has its roots in an instructional delivery method known as the <a href="http://legacyrlmoore.org/reference/mahavier1.html">Moore Method</a> (sometimes referred to as the Texas Method), named after <a href="http://legacyrlmoore.org/method.html">R.L. Moore</a>. In 1966, Moore wrote:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      That student is taught the best who is told the least.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    In the words of J. Parker:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Robert Lee Moore (1882-1974) was a towering figure in twentieth century mathematics, internationally recognized as founder of his own school of topology, which produced some of the most significant mathematicians in that field. The 50 students he guided to their PhDs can today claim 1,678 doctoral descendants. Many of them are still teaching courses in the style of their mentor, known universally as the Moore Method, which he devised. Its principal edicts virtually prohibit students from using textbooks during the learning process, call for only the briefest of lectures in class and demand no collaboration or conferring between classmates. (Exceptions were Moore&#8217;s calculus and analytic geometry courses in which textbooks were used for setting problems. His doctoral students were allowed to refer to the literature mainly to ensure their theses were original.) It is in essence a Socratic method that encourages students to solve problems using their own skills of critical analysis and creativity. Moore summed it up in just eleven words: &#8216;That student is taught the best who is told the least.&#8217;
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Loosely speaking, the majority of a Moore Method course consists of students presenting proofs/solutions that they have produced independently from material provided by the instructor. In a traditional Moore Method course, students are discouraged, in fact forbidden, to collaborate. Variations of the Moore Method take many forms and are often referred to by the generic name &#8220;modified-Moore method.&#8221; In particular, one modification I make is that I not only allow students to work together, I encourage it. The Moore Method or one of its modifications is typically associated with pedagogies including inquiry-based, discovery-based, student-centered, Socratic, and constructivist learning.
