    Several weeks ago, links to a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1856">survey article</a> by Jeffrey Lagarias about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Euler&#8217;s</a> work and its modern developments and a <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/eulers-constants/">blog post</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Lipton">Richard J. Lipton</a> that discusses Lagarias&#8217; paper were circulated on Google+. I&#8217;d like to thank <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103069458643902853500/about">Luiz Guzman</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/108471684130503622159/about">Joerg Fliege</a> for first bringing these items to my attention.

    Lagarias&#8217; paper is full of lots of yummy goodies, but my favorite part is his summary of Euler&#8217;s approach to research (see Section 2.6 of the paper or the end of Lipton&#8217;s post).

  <h2>
    Euler&#8217;s Research Rules
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Taken directly from the paper, here is Lagarias&#8217; summary of Euler&#8217;s research rules.
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Always attack a special problem. If possible solve the special problem in a way that leads to a general method.
    </li>
    <li>
      Read and digest every earlier attempts at a theory of the phenomenon in question.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let a key problem solved be a father to a key problem posed. The new problem finds its place on the structure provided by the solution of the old; its solution in turn will provide further structure.
    </li>
    <li>
      If two special problems solved seem cognate to each other, try to unite them in a general scheme. To do so, set aside the differences, and try to build a structure on the common features.
    </li>
    <li>
      Never rest content with an imperfect or incomplete argument. If you cannot complete and perfect it yourself, lay bare its flaws for others to see.
    </li>
    <li>
      Never abandon a problem you have solved. There are always better ways. Keep searching for them, for they lead to a fuller understanding. While broadening, deepen and simplify.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Lipton&#8217;s blog post also lists &#8220;Euler&#8217;s Research Rules.&#8221; My main motivation for reposting them here is to remind myself to follow them!
