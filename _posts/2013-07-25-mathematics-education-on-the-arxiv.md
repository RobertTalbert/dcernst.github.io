  <p>
    I&#8217;ve recently finished coauthoring two different math education papers. Both papers have been submitted for publication. Neither paper is likely to change the world, but I still want to openly share what we have. Like most mathematicians, I&#8217;ve posted my pure mathematics research articles on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>. In case you don&#8217;t already know, the arXiv was started in 1991 as an electronic archive and distribution server for research articles. Covered areas include physics, mathematics, computer science, nonlinear sciences, quantitative biology, and statistics. Readers can retrieve papers off the arXiv via their web interface and authors can submit articles (and resubmit if they make changes). It is standard practice for mathematicians to post their articles on the arXiv prior to submitting them for publication. In fact, some articles only appear on the arXiv. When I want to find a particular article, I first look for it on the arXiv. In short, the arXiv is awesome.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, when I went to go look for a mathematics education category, I was surprised to see it was not among the <a href="http://arxiv.org/archive/math">list of mathematics categories</a>. The <a href="http://arxiv.org/list/math.HO/new">math.HO &#8211; History and Overview</a> category lists mathematics education as one of the possible topics, but it doesn&#8217;t appear to be commonly used for this purpose. In contrast, there is an active <a href="http://arxiv.org/list/physics.ed-ph/recent">physics education</a> category.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After exploring this a little further, it doesn&#8217;t appear that there is a culture among math ed folks to use pre-print servers like the arXiv. I think this is unfortunate and I&#8217;d like to help change this. If there is going to be cultural shift, I believe that there should be a dedicated place for math ed papers. Authors need to know where to submit papers and readers need to know where to look. A category called History and Overview doesn&#8217;t cut it in my view. A precedent has been set by the physics education crew and we should follow in their footsteps. I&#8217;d also like to point out that Mathematics Education is listed as one of the <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html">American Mathematical Society&#8217;s subject classification codes</a>, namely <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html?t=97-XX&s=&btn=Search&ls=Ct">number 97</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have two proposals:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      The category math.ED &#8211; Mathematics Education be added to the arXiv.
    </li>
    <li>
      Math ed people start posting to the arXiv (when copyright allows it).
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    A couple days ago, I contacted the arXiv about the first item and here is their response:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The creation of a new subject class requires considerable support from the community that will use it. We do not want to create subject classes that will be useless because of under use.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      More precisely, we require a commitment from a significant group of researchers to submit papers using the proposed subject class. This should include promises to submit a number of initial papers to get the subject class going (a solution to the chicken-and-egg problem).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If this issue is important to you then you must first start by canvassing support from your community. If you receive overwhelming support, and have a significant number of researchers who have agreed to use arXiv, please feel free to contact us again with more specific information.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I then followed up and asked for clarification about what &#8220;overwhelming support&#8221; and &#8220;significant number of researchers&#8221; means, to which they replied:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Overwhelming support would include quite a number (more than, say 50) prominent researchers who agree that such as category should be added, and who would agree to make use of it.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Okay, that sounds like a lot of people to try to get on board, but I say, let&#8217;s go for it. One obvious question: what&#8217;s the best way to gather interest and then record this interest to the arXiv? Would a petition be sufficient?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the arXiv&#8217;s first response to me, they also said:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We also need a volunteer to moderate the class by reviewing daily submissions and flagging inappropriate submissions. This moderator should also review a significant number of already archived papers, looking for submissions that can be cross-listed to the new subject class and contact authors encouraging them to do so.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t think I am the appropriate person for this and I&#8217;m not really willing to take it on anyway. Any volunteers?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Update, July 27, 2013:</em> There is now a petition on <a href="http://change.org">Change.org</a>. If you are in favor of the arXiv including math.ED &#8211; Mathematics Education as a category, please sign the petition. If you would also utilize this category by uploading articles related to mathematics education, please leave a comment (on the petition) indicating that this is the case. You can find the petition <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/arxiv-org-add-math-ed-mathematics-education-category-to-arxiv">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>Update, July 28, 2013:</em> We&#8217;ve exceeded 100 signatures on the petition to get math.ED &#8211; Mathematics Education added to the arXiv. The next step is to round up 2&#8211;3 volunteers to help moderate category submissions. I don&#8217;t think this requires a tremendous amount of work. I&#8217;d like to have a list of potential moderators before I contact the arXiv again. Any takers? After all is said and done, there is no guarantee that the mathematics subject board at the arXiv will approve our request. However, they asked for support from at least 50 people and we have 100. Fingers crossed.
