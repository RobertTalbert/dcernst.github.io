    Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, yada, yada, yada. Each of these social networking sites has something to offer and I have accounts on most of them. However, I think it may be time to streamline. Increasingly, I feel pressed for time to do all the things that I need and want to do. There&#8217;s an endless amount of work-related stuff to do, but I also want to be a good father and husband. Moreover, if I don&#8217;t squeeze in time for exercise, I&#8217;m not very good at anything. I&#8217;m like a dog. If I don&#8217;t get in a walk, I might chew the furniture.

    I currently have two accounts on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/danaernst">@danaernst</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IBLMath">@IBLMath</a>. Why two accounts? Most of my tweets are math-related, but not all of them. I created @IBLMath for two main reasons. First, I wanted to increase awareness of <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/?page=What_is_IBL">inquiry-based learning</a> in mathematics. Second, I thought it was a good idea to have an account that was solely devoted to tweeting about math and teaching-related content. At the time of writing this post, I&#8217;ve tweeted 4,445 times from @danaernst, and according to <a href="http://howlonghaveyoubeentweeting.com">How long have you been tweeting?</a>, I made my first tweet on March 4, 2009. Twitter has been an amazing resource for me.

    Then along came <a href="https://plus.google.com">Google+</a>, which launched in June of 2011. I don&#8217;t know the exact date that I joined, but it was within the first few weeks. I connected with quite a few academics early on and now I have a substantial network of people interested in mathematics, teaching, and technology. In fact, nearly all the people that I enjoy most on Twitter are also on G+. Since my network on G+ is so much larger than on Twitter, I often encounter content on G+ that I don&#8217;t see on Twitter, but I rarely see content on Twitter that doesn&#8217;t pop up on G+. Moreover, the interaction that happens on G+ is often much more substantial than what I&#8217;ve experienced on Twitter. I regularly cross-post content on Twitter and G+ and it&#8217;s not uncommon for one of my &#8220;popular&#8221; posts on G+ to see zero attention on Twitter.

    I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while now whether maintaining my Twitter presence is worth my time. One of my weaknesses is that I&#8217;m not very good at doing things part-way. I&#8217;m an all or nothing kind of guy. As a result of this, I find myself feeling anxious when I&#8217;m not caught up on surfing Twitter, G+, Facebook, etc. posts. The reality is that I don&#8217;t have time to even come close to keeping up. The rate of new content is overwhelming. My first semester at NAU has been successful, but I need to find ways to be even more efficient and effective at work, family, and play. In this vein, I&#8217;m looking for ways to trim unnecessary things from my life. I don&#8217;t plan to give up social media, but I think that I can save myself actual time and certainly some mental and emotional bandwidth by walking away from Twitter.

    I&#8217;ll treat this as an experiment and see how it goes after a few months. I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ll miss it. I will likely continue to advertise my blog posts (from this blog and my <a href="http://elevationgain.danaernst.com">Elevation Gain</a> blog) on Twitter and respond to @mentions.
