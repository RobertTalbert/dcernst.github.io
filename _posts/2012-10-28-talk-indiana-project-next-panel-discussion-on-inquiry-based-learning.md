    Yesterday, I was part of a panel discussion about inquiry-based learning (IBL) at the Fall 2012 <a href="http://sections.maa.org/indiana/">Indiana MAA Section Meeting</a>. The other panelists included <a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/talbertr/Robert_Talbert,_PhD/Welcome.html">Robert Talbert</a> (Grand Valley State University) and <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/mcs/faculty/mindycapaldi.php">Mindi Capaldi</a> (Valparaiso University). The panel was organized by the <a href="http://sections.maa.org/indiana/NEXT.html">Indiana Section NExT</a>, which is the Indiana version of the national <a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/">Project NExT</a>. Here is the abstract for the session:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We will discuss inquiry based learning, inverted classroom models, peer instruction, and other alternatives to lecture-based instruction. Panelists will give a brief intro of their experience in these areas, followed by an extended time of Q&A with the audience. This panel is open to all meeting participants.
    </p>

    You might be wondering how I ended up at the Indiana MAA Section Meeting. One of my Project NExT fellows, <a href="http://faculty.valpo.edu/lpudwell/">Lara Pudwell</a> (Valparaiso University), sent me a message several weeks ago asking if I knew anyone near Indiana that would be interested in speaking on a panel about inquiry-based learning. I told her that I wasn&#8217;t anywhere near Indiana, but that I would love to be a part of the panel. Since I&#8217;m not swimming in travel money, I contacted <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~styoshin/">Stan Yoshinobu</a> (Cal Poly and Director of the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/">Academy of Inquiry Based Learning</a>) to see if the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/?page=VSB">Visiting Speakers Bureau</a> might be able to pay my way. Thankfully, my request for travel funding was approved. Woot! I&#8217;d like to thank AIBL and the <a href="http://eduadvance.org/">Educational Advancement Foundation</a> for funding these sorts of things.

    The panel discussion was well-attended and it seemed to go very well. Each of the three panelist spoke for about 5-10 minutes and then the floor was opened to questions. The questions (during the session and later at lunch) covered a variety of topics, but as expected, people were interested in how to implement IBL in large classes and/or courses where coverage of a significant amount of content is a requirement. In my opinion, these are two of the biggest obstacles to adopting all sorts of effective and progressive teaching approaches. The obstacles are not insurmountable, but modifications (and compromises) of how I might run my upper-level proof-based classes must be made. I&#8217;ll try to write a post that addresses some potential strategies for dealing with large classes and the coverage issue.
