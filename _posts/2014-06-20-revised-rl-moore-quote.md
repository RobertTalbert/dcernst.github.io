<div class="kcite-section" kcite-section-id="1218">
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s a classic quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lee_Moore">RL Moore</a>:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      That student is taught the best who is told the least.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    During his talk yesterday at the <a href="http://legacyrlmoore.org/events.html">RL Moore Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Clark18">David Clark</a> provided a slight modification:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The student is taught the best who is told only enough to ensure that he or she will continue to work hard, stay engaged, and make progress.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    I think David&#8217;s revision does an excellent job of capturing the experience I hope to provide the students in my <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) classes with.
