Here's a classic quote from [RL Moore][1]:

> That student is taught the best who is told the least. 

During his talk yesterday at the [RL Moore Conference][2], [David Clark][3] provided a slight modification:

> The student is taught the best who is told only enough to ensure that he or she will continue to work hard, stay engaged, and make progress. 

I think David's revision does an excellent job of capturing the experience I hope to provide the students in my [inquiry-based learning][4] (IBL) classes with.
