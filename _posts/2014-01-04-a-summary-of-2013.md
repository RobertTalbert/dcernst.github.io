    This blog was viewed about 16,000 times in 2013. My <a href="http://teaching.danaernst.com">teaching page</a> is a subdomain of my main site, so I&#8217;m guessing that a good chunk of that 16,000 is a result of my students clicking around (but I&#8217;m not sure about that). In 2013, there were 29 new posts, growing the total archive of this blog to 63 posts.

    I would have expected Google+ to be the top referrer and I&#8217;m a bit surprised that Facebook made the list at all. I&#8217;m happy to see that being a part of Booles&#8217; Rings (a network of academic home pages/blogs) is bringing some traffic this way and I hope that I&#8217;m reciprocating at least a little.

    I guess it&#8217;s no surprise that I was the top commenter. It is worth pointing out that François and Peter are also members of <a href="http://boolesrings.org">Booles&#8217; Rings</a>.
