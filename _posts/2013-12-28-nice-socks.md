<img src="http://i2.wp.com/danaernst.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/socks-224x300.jpg?w=224" alt="socks" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1138" data-recalc-dims="1" /> On page 36 of the [December 2013/January 2014 issue][1] of the [MAA FOCUS][2] there is a short article about [Math Ed Matters][3], which is a monthly blog/column sponsored by the [Mathematical Association of America][4] and coauthored by [Angie Hodge][5] and myself. The article, written by Katharine Merow, highlights a few of our recent posts and describes some potential future posts (I should write these down, so we remember to write the advertised posts!). Katharine wanted to include a picture of Angie and me for the article, and as you can see in the picture to the left, she chose one of us that was taken after we had finished a trail run. I&#8217;m also wearing some ridiculous looking socks! The socks are actually [compression socks designed for running][6], but they look silly nonetheless. I&#8217;ve been getting some flak for wearing such tall socks, but I think it&#8217;s funny.

I knew this article was going to appear, but I wasn&#8217;t sure when. It was brought to my attention by [Robert Jacobson][7] via one of his [Google+ posts][8]. Robert is responsible for the photo.
