  <p>
    I highly recommend watching this video of Professor <a href="http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/starbird/">Michael Starbird</a> (University of Texas) presenting his insights into the philosophy of teaching at the <a href="http://www.maa.org/prep/2012/inquiry.html">Mathematical Association of America PREP Workshop</a> called &#8220;Using Inquiry Based Learning in Second-Year Calculus and Courses for Prospective Teachers&#8221;, which took place at UC Santa Barbara, June 2012.
