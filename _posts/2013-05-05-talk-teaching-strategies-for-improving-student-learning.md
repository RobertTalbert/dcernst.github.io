    On Saturday, May 5, 2013, I was joined by <a href="http://www.uni.edu/theron/">TJ Hitchman</a> (University of Northern Iowa) for the Michigan Project NExT Panel Discussion on Teaching Strategies for Improving Student Learning, which was part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/2013michiganmaa/home">2013 Spring MAA Michigan Section Meeting</a> at <a href="http://www.lssu.edu">Lake Superior State University</a>. The title of the session was &#8220;Teaching Strategies for Improving Student Learning&#8221; and was organized by <a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/talbertr/Robert_Talbert,_PhD/Welcome.html">Robert Talbert</a> (Grand Valley State University). The dynamic looking guy in the photo above is TJ.

    Here is the abstract for the session.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Are you interested in helping your students learn mathematics more effectively? Are you thinking about branching out in the way you teach your courses? If so, you should attend this panel discussion featuring short talks from leaders in higher education in employing innovative and effective instructional strategies in their mathematics classes. After speaking, our panelists will lead breakout discussions in small groups to answer questions and share advice about effective instructional strategies for college mathematics. Panelists will include Dana Ernst (Northern Arizona University) and Theron Hitchman (University of Northern Iowa), both noted for their effective use of the flipped classroom and inquiry-based learning.

    Sweet, I guess running my mouth often enough about <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/?page=What_is_IBL">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) gets me &#8220;noted.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each of TJ and I took about 10-15 minutes to discuss our respective topics and then we took the remaining time to chat and brainstorm as a group. The focus of my portion of the panel was on &#8220;Inquiry-Based Learning: What, Why, and How?&#8221; My talk was a variation on several similar talks that I&#8217;ve given over the past year. For TJ&#8217;s portion, he discussed his <a href="http://theronhitchman.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/the-big-unteaching-experiment-first-major-report/">Big &#8220;Unteaching&#8221; Experiment</a> that he implemented in his Spring 2013 differential geometry course.

    Here are the slides for my portion of the panel.

    Despite low attendance at the panel, I think it went well. Thanks to Robert for inviting TJ and me!
