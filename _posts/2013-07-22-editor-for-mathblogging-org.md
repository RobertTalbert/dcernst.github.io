  <p>
    A couple of days ago, <a href="http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/">Peter Krautzberger</a> sent me an email asking if I was interested in becoming an editor for <a href="http://mathblogging.org">Mathblogging.org</a>. According to Mathblogging.org&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/about">about</a> page:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      From research to recreational, from teaching to technology, from visual to virtual, hundreds of blogs and sites regularly write about mathematics in all its facets. For the longest time, there was no good way for readers to find the authors they enjoy and for authors to be found. We want to change that. We have collected over 700 blogs and other news sources in one place, and invite you to submit even more! Our goal is to be the best place to discover mathematical writing on the web.

    Mathblogging.org is run by <a href="http://boolesrings.org/scoskey/">Samuel Coskey</a>, <a href="http://boolesrings.org/vonheymann/">Frederik von Heymann</a>, and Peter. <a href="http://www.felixbreuer.net/">Felix Breuer</a> also had a hand in the site&#8217;s creation. The current editors are <a href="http://mrhonner.com/">Peter Honner</a>, <a href="http://fawnnguyen.com/">Fawn Nguyen</a>, and <a href="http://math-frolic.blogspot.com/">Shecky Riemann</a>.
  </p>

    Lately, I&#8217;ve been feeling stretched a bit thin, so I told Peter that I needed to think about it before deciding. I&#8217;ve been trying to be careful about the new projects I take on so that I don&#8217;t get in over my head. But&#8230;then I remembered the talk that <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~jgallian/">Joe Gallian</a> gave at the conclusion of my first <a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/projnext/">Project NExT</a> workshop in 2008. The theme of Joe&#8217;s talk (which he gives every year for Project NExT) is &#8220;just say yes.&#8221; His thesis is that by saying &#8220;yes&#8221; we open doors to new opportunities and by saying &#8220;no&#8221; we close ourselves off to what might have been. Okay, I&#8217;m sure Joe would admit that we shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;yes&#8221; to everything, but I believe he would say that most of us say &#8220;no&#8221; too often.

    I took Joe&#8217;s talk pretty seriously my first few years post PhD and I think it has worked out pretty darn well for me. There have been numerous times I thought that I should say &#8220;no&#8221; but followed Joe&#8217;s advice instead. Most of the time it has worked out for the best. A good example is when <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ivarspeterson/">Ivars Peterson</a> asked <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/">Angie Hodge</a> and I to start blogging for the <a href="http://maa.org">MAA</a>. Actually, let me back up a notch. First, <a href="https://faculty.bentley.edu/details.asp?uname=ncarter">Nathan Carter</a> suggested that I apply for the editor position at <a href="http://www.maa.org//publications/periodicals/math-horizons">Math Horizons</a>. I implemented Joe&#8217;s philosophy and talked Angie into applying with me as co-editors. Alas, we were not chosen and instead the committee selected the most awesome <a href="http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/">Dave Richeson</a>. However, as a result of our application, Ivars approached Angie and I about starting up <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/">Math Ed Matters</a>. Around this time, I was beginning a new position at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> and I was concerned that my tenure committee wouldn&#8217;t value this sort of work. I dragged my feet for a couple months, but eventually Joe&#8217;s voice in my head won out. Angie and I have only been blogging for a few months, but we certainly made the right decision. Lots of new opportunities have presented themselves as a result of the blog. I could go on and on about similar choices.

    Okay, by now you&#8217;ve already guessed that I agreed to Peter&#8217;s offer. So, what does being an editor entail? I already keep up with quite a few math-related blogs, but now I just need to &#8220;star&#8221; the ones on mathblogging.org that I find the most interesting/enjoyable/useful/compelling and leave a brief comment about them. Doesn&#8217;t sound too bad. Of course, to be fair I should start reading a few more of the blogs that pass through.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yesterday was my first day on the job and I already selected two recent blog posts for Editors&#8217; Picks:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/post/59279">Name 5 top journals you readâ€¦</a> by <a href="http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/">Peter Krautzberger</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/post/58380">A Problem with Assessment</a> by <a href="http://www.uni.edu/theron/">TJ Hitchman</a>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m looking forward to reading more excellent blog posts and seeing if Joe is right again.
