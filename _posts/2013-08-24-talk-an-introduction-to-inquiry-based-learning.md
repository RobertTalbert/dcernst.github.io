    On Thursday, August 22, I was one of four speakers that gave a 20 minute talk during the Department of Mathematics and Statistics Teaching Showcase at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a>. My talk was titled &#8220;An Introduction to Inquiry-Based Learning&#8221; and was intended to be a &#8220;high altitude&#8221; view of IBL and to inspire dialogue. I was impressed with the turn out. I think there were roughly 40 people in attendance, from graduate students to tenured faculty and even some administrators. Here are the slides for my talk.

    If you take a look at the slides, you&#8217;ll see that I mention some recent research about the effectiveness of IBL by <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/eer/research/steminquiry.html">Sandra Laursen, et. al</a>. During my talk, I provided a two-page summary of this research, which you can grab <a href="http://danaernst.com/talks/IBLMathTwoPageSummary.pdf">here</a> (PDF).

    After about 15 minutes, I transitioned into an exercise whose purpose was to get the audience thinking about appropriate ways to engage in dialogue with students in an IBL class. I provided the participants with the handout located <a href="http://danaernst.com/talks/SeriesDialogue.pdf">here</a> that contains a dialogue between three students that are working together on exploring the notions of convergence and divergence of series. After the dialogue, five possible responses for the instructor are provided. I invited the participants to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each possible response. It is clear that some responses are better than others, but all of the responses listed intentionally have some weaknesses. We were able to spend a couple of minutes having audience members share their thoughts. It would have been better to spend more time on this exercise. I wish I could take credit for the exercise, but I borrowed it from the folks over at <a href="http://www.artofmathematics.org/">Discovering the Art of Mathematics</a>.
