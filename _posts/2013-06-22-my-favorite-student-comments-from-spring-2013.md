    When I was preparing <a href="http://danaernst.com/talk-implementing-ibl-in-an-introduction-to-proof-course/">my talk</a> for the <a href="http://legacyrlmoore.org/events.html">Legacy of R.L. Moore Conference</a> a couple weeks ago, I reread the student evaluations for my <a href="http://teaching.danaernst.com/mat320s13/">introduction to proof course</a> from Spring 2013. I was really pleased with all the comments, but two of them stood out because they capture the essence of what I want an <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) experience to be.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s the first comment.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      [&#8230;] he has found the perfect way to teach this course. [&#8230;] The way Professor Ernst had us struggle through homework and then come together as a group and discuss the topics was very beneficial. I personally struggled through most of the material and when I finally got to the right concept I felt like I fully understood it because I personally came to that conclusion. Also, when I didnâ€™t fully understand a topic, coming together and discussing it connected all the gaps I was missing. [&#8230;] As a future educator, I would love to mimic his style of teaching so I can share with my students the same satisfaction that I got out of this style of teaching.

    I stripped out a couple complimentary sentences that addressed me rather than the course. Of course, I&#8217;m thrilled about this student&#8217;s desire to incorporate IBL in their future teaching, but what I really appreciate about this comment is how the student reflects on both his/her independence and collaboration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is the second, very short comment.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Try, fail, understand, win.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    Four words of awesomeness. I couldn&#8217;t hope for more. This second comment inspired a <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/06/try-fail-understand-win.html">recent post</a> that <a href="https://plus.google.com/101669268593951464238/posts">Angie Hodge</a> and I recently wrote for <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com">Math Ed Matters</a>.
