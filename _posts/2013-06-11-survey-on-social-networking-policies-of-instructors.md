    Dear College Instructors,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~leingang/">Matthew Leingang</a> (NYU), <a href="http://www.berry.edu/academics/science/fsdetail.aspx?id=3451">Ron Taylor</a> (Berry College), and I are interested in how college instructors utilize social media. In particular, we are curious how teachers interact with their current and past students on social networks like Facebook and Google+. How do you interact with your current and former students on social media? Do you have policies about this interaction? We have put together a short survey to gather some data regarding this often sensitive issue. The intent is to summarize the results in a short article that will likely be submitted to <a href="http://www.maa.org/pubs/focus.html">MAA FOCUS</a>. We would be thrilled if you would take a few minutes to complete <a href="https://nyu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_cPkDH0pY0zKp6dv">our short survey</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dana, Matthew, & Ron
