  <p>
    The past two years, <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/">Angie Hodge</a>, <a href="http://www.stanyoshinobu.com">Stan Yoshinobu</a>, and I have organized an Inquiry-Based Learning Best Practices special session at <a href="http://www.maa.org/meetings/mathfest">MathFest</a>. We&#8217;ve had a fantastic turn out in terms of speakers and attendees both years. This year we thought we would try something new and decided to organize a poster session instead. Here&#8217;s the abstract for the session:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      New and experienced instructors implementing inquiry-based learning methods are invited to share their experiences, resources, and insights in this poster session. The posters in this session will focus on IBL best practices. We seek both novel ideas and effective approaches to IBL. Claims made should be supported by data (student responses, sample work, test scores, survey results, etc.). This session will be of interest to instructors new to IBL, as well as experienced practitioners looking for new ideas. Presenters should have their materials prepared in advance and will be provided with a self-standing, trifold tabletop poster approximately 48 in wide by 36 in high.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    One of our goals of the poster session is to increase interaction between presenters and attendees. We hope that someone can wander around and gather a lot of information about implementing IBL in a short period of time. I&#8217;m not usually a fan of poster sessions, but I&#8217;m looking forward to this one. The poster session takes place on Thursday, August 7 at 3:30-5:00PM in the Hilton Portland, Plaza Level, Plaza Foyer. If you are attending MathFest, please stop by the poster session. Also, if you think you have something interesting to share, we encourage you to <a href="http://www.maa.org/mathfest/abstracts">submit an abstract</a>. The deadline for submission is Friday, June 13, 2014.
