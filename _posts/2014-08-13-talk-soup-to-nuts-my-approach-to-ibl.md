    Prior to this summer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.maa.org/meetings/mathfest">MathFest</a> in Portland, I was a co-facilitator for a four-day <a href="http://iblworkshop.org/home.html">workshop on inquiry-based learning</a>. My co-facilitators were <a href="http://www.stanyoshinobu.com">Stan Yoshinobu</a> (Cal Poly, SLO), <a href="http://www.csudh.edu/math/mjones/">Matt Jones</a> (CSU Dominguez Hills), and <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/">Angie Hodge</a> (University of Nebraska at Omaha). I love being a part of these workshops. Even though I&#8217;m there to help others get started on implementing IBL, I benefit tremendously from the experience and always leave feeling energized and fired up to teach. If you are an aspiring practitioner or a newish user of IBL, I highly encourage you to look into attending a future <a href="http://iblworkshop.org/home.html">IBL Workshop</a>, which is run as an <a href="http://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/prep-workshops">MAA PREP workshop</a>.
  </p>

    On day three of the workshop, I gave a 30-minute plenary talk. Most of the sessions are designed to be highly interactive and this was one of the few times that we &#8220;talked at&#8221; the participants. At the end of day two, I had given the participants a choice of topics for the plenary and the request was to describe the general overview of my approach to IBL in proof-based classes versus a class like calculus. So, that&#8217;s what I set out to do. The slides I used for my talk can be found below.

    I&#8217;d like to think that my talk was more than the content of the slides, however, the slides ought be useful on their own for someone that is curious <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">about IBL</a>. This talk was similar to others about IBL that <a href="http://danaernst.com/?s=inquiry-based+learning+talk">I&#8217;ve given in the past</a>.
