Prior to this summer&#8217;s [MathFest][1] in Portland, I was a co-facilitator for a four-day [workshop on inquiry-based learning][2]. My co-facilitators were [Stan Yoshinobu][3] (Cal Poly, SLO), [Matt Jones][4] (CSU Dominguez Hills), and [Angie Hodge][5] (University of Nebraska at Omaha). I love being a part of these workshops. Even though I&#8217;m there to help others get started on implementing IBL, I benefit tremendously from the experience and always leave feeling energized and fired up to teach. If you are an aspiring practitioner or a newish user of IBL, I highly encourage you to look into attending a future [IBL Workshop][2], which is run as an [MAA PREP workshop][6].

On day three of the workshop, I gave a 30-minute plenary talk. Most of the sessions are designed to be highly interactive and this was one of the few times that we &#8220;talked at&#8221; the participants. At the end of day two, I had given the participants a choice of topics for the plenary and the request was to describe the general overview of my approach to IBL in proof-based classes versus a class like calculus. So, that&#8217;s what I set out to do. The slides I used for my talk can be found below.

I&#8217;d like to think that my talk was more than the content of the slides, however, the slides ought be useful on their own for someone that is curious [about IBL][7]. This talk was similar to others about IBL that [I&#8217;ve given in the past][8].
