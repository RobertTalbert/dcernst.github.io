    On Friday, September 20, I gave a 30-minute talk titled &#8220;Proofs without Words&#8221; during NAU&#8217;s <a href="http://oak.ucc.nau.edu/jws8/FAMUSflyer.pdf">Friday Afternoon Undergraduate Mathematics Seminar</a> (FAMUS). As the name of the seminar suggests, the target audience for FAMUS is undergraduates. I usually give a couple talks at FAMUS each semester and this was my first of the semester. Here is the abstract <em>with words</em> for my talk.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In this FAMUS talk, we&#8217;ll explore several cool mathematical theorems from a visual perspective.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    The talk basically went like this. I displayed a figure or drawing and then the goal was for the audience to come up with the corresponding theorem. I had a ton of fun and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The initial idea for the talk came from the book <a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/books/charming-proofs-a-journey-into-elegant-mathematics"><em>Charming Proofs: A Journey into Elegant Mathematics</em></a> by Claudi Alsina and Roger B. Nelsen. This is a wonderful book that incorporates lots of visual proofs. If you don&#8217;t have a copy, I highly recommend it. I borrowed lots of ideas from it when I taught a class titled &#8220;Introduction to Formal Mathematics&#8221; while I was at <a href="http://plymouth.edu">Plymouth State University</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My original plan was to recreate a lot of the figures I had in mind using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ">TikZ</a>, but I should have known that I wouldn&#8217;t have time for that. When I was brainstorming the talk a couple days before, I decided to do a Google search in the hope that I could find some figures to borrow that others had already made. In my search, I stumbled on several references to &#8220;proof without words&#8221;, which is what I ultimately named my talk. In fact, there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">Wikipedia entry</a> and Roger B. Nelsen also wrote a book called <a href="http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/proofs-without-words-exercises-in-visual-thinking"><em>Proofs without Words: Exercises in Visual Thinking</em></a>. Moreover, I was thrilled to find <em>lots</em> of cool figures on the Internet. For my talk, I <em>borrowed</em> images and content from the following sources:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/8846/proofs-without-words">MathOverflow</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/index.php/Proofs_without_words">Art of Problem Solving</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">Wikipedia</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    In the end, my slides ended up being a sample each of these three sources. If you are ready to see some cool figures, check out the slides below. I&#8217;ve left the pauses in so that you can ponder the theorem before you see it.

    As anticipated, I had more figures than I had time to discuss, but we did get through most of them.

    The custom at FAMUS is to interview a faculty member after the 30 minute talk. The usual FAMUS host, Jeff Rushall, was out of town, so I was filling in for him. I had the honor of interviewing <a href="http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/">Michael Falk</a>. This was fun for me because Mike was my masters thesis advisor.
