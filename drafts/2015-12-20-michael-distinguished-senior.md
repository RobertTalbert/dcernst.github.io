On Thursday, I gave a short statement of accomplishments in honor of Michael Hastings being awarded "The Distinguished Senior" for the College of Engineering, Forestry, and Natural Sciences at [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu). Michael was a student in two of my classes (Foundations of Mathematics and Abstract Algebra) and he was also one of my [undergraduate research students]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/undergraduate-research/) on two different year-long projects.  



A good mathematician (or physicist) wants to know “how”.
But a great one wants to know “why".

A good mathematician "answers questions".
But a great one "questions answers".

A good mathematician can "get out of a tricky corner".
But a great one can “get into a tricky corner".

Michael is one of the great ones.

The world is changing faster and faster. We must prepare students to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. We need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of. This is a challenge for which physicists and mathematicians are particularly well-suited.

Proving new theorems, discovering new connections in abstract fields is the modern day equivalent to slaying dragons. To many that study such disciplines, they feel they are uncovering the poetry of the universe.

This is a valid pursuit in and of itself.  It’s one of the things that makes us human.  We wonder, we explore.

As an added bonus, it is often true that playing archeologist with the abstract provides opportunities for human advancement.

For most of us, two skills necessary for success are a strong work ethic and the ability to persevere despite setbacks.  Michael possesses both of these in abundance; yet his intellectual talent and problem solving skills are what distinguish him.

Not only is Michael brilliant, he is extremely motivated to learn.  He has a relentless thirst for knowledge that is refreshing and rarely encountered.  He has an unending enthusiasm for learning and is constantly striving to understand both the big picture and the smallest details.

While a student at NAU, Michael has double-majored in physics and mathematics. But not just double-majored, he is among the best in both programs. In response to his involvement on campus, he was recently selected as one of NAU's "Gold Axe” recipients.

Michael has conducted two different year-long research projects in mathematics. The first project focused on factorizing Temperley—Lieb diagrams, which has applications in physics. The second project involved prime vertex labelings of discrete graphs, which has potential applications in computer science. His work has resulted in a total of 3 publications.

But! By far, Michael’s greatest gift is his loud and extremely obnoxious laugh!

I am grateful that I was able to share in Michael’s experience at NAU and I will miss having him around.  Congratulations Michael!
